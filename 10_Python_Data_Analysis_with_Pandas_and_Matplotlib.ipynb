        "Pandas is a hugely popular, and still growing, Python library used across a range of disciplines from environmental and climate science, through to social science, linguistics, biology, as well as a number of applications in industry such as data analytics, financial trading, and many others. In the [Introduction to Python tutorial](https://ourcodingclub.github.io/tutorials/python-intro/index.html) we had a look at how Python had grown rapidly in terms of users over the last decade or so, based on traffic to the [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) question and answer site. A similar graph has been produced showing the growth of Pandas compared to some other Python software libraries! (Based on StackOverflow question views per month).\n",

        "*   Tabular data with heterogeneously-typed columns, as in an SQL table or Excel spreadsheet.\n",
        "*   Ordered and unordered (not necessarily fixed-frequency) time series data.\n",
        "* Arbitrary matrix data (homogeneously typed or heterogeneous) with row and column labels.\n",
        "* Any other form of observational / statistical data sets. The data actually need not be labelled at all to be placed into a `pandas` data structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "Some other important points to note about Pandas are:\n",
        "* Pandas is **fast**. Python sometimes gets a bad rap for being a bit slow compared to ‘compiled’ languages such as C and Fortran. But deep down in the internals of Pandas, it is actually written in C, and so processing large datasets is no problem for Pandas.\n",

        "\n",
        "Here we briefly discuss the different ways you can folow this tutorial. There are lots of different ways to run Python programs, and I don’t want to prescribe any one way as being the ‘best’. Users of RStudio and Matlab may find that the **Spyder** programming environment most closely matches the feel of RStudio and Matlab, with a window for editing scripts and an ‘interactive’ mode that can be used along side. For a more minimalist approach, you may prefer to write their scripts/programs in a text editor such as Notepadd++ (Windows), vim, emacs, or other popular editors. (But do not use Windows Notepad!). Personally this is how I like to work with Python as it frees you from the distractions of an IDE like Spyder, and reduces the number of problems that can arise from the Spyder program being set-up incorrectly.\n",

It is a useful complement to Pandas, and like Pandas, is a very feature-rich library which can produce a large variety of plots, charts, maps, and other visualisations. It would be impossible to cover the entirety of Matplotlib in one tutorial, so this section is really to give you a flavour of the capabilities of Matplotlib, and to cover some of the basics, as well as a couple of more interesting ‘advanced’ features.\n",

A great starting point is the [Matplotlib gallery of examples](https://matplotlib.org/gallery.html). I recommend this because in practice it is difficult to cover each and every plot type, as the needs of scientists differ considerably depending on the type of data they are working with or the message they are trying to convey in their visualisation.
